Bugs:

- Dst loc bugs on first use


Before Beta:

    - Vrise Finish:
        -> Make CCC work

    - Terms and conditions

    - Account Settings:
      -Accreditation / Drawn By / Checked By / Approved by
      -Username
      -Password

    - Save rework:
        saving the serials
        erasing Mppts if changing inverter_dictionaries -> this might just need a dict rework where the job dict is incremented
        saving the max current for each phase
        DATETIME SAVE

After Beta:
    - Design Type : Preliminary Design/As-Built
    - Upgrade the menuBar
    - Voc to be adjusted for temperature (Idea include table 4.1 of 5033)
    - Connect the inv phases to Vrise calculations
    - Saving fav components
    - Think about couloring in red the critical info as well as warning message to make more user friendly
    - Vrise page to show 4777 regulations
    - Overcurrent protection devices sizing
    - Improve the show limits function + !!! Voc & Vmp options
    - Upgrade the inverter selection bar:
      -> Make a 1P - 3P button (stays blue when pressed) that helps shortens the inverter list
    - Add another page after layout where you choose what you want
    - Page Redo:
      -Separate page 1-2 and page 3 so that each excel template as his own layout page (i.e template specific folder)
        -> I think Voltage rise needs to come last
        -> down the road they will be the downloadable extension
        -> Maybe the gateway should go into each Template
        -> Same for the excel print function it should be included in the template specific folder
      - Have an first menu (after the login):
        -> Option 1 calculate a Vrise
        -> Option 2 make an sld
        -> Option 3 calculate the output
    -Change the way the Job dict works to add sections depending on job_Type
    -Mixing different Panels
    -Problem when saving an error (For example solar edge mppt b1 a2)
    -Option to add on to existing inverters
    -Battery option -> make a battery_dict
    -Current carrying capacity to be improved for all wire type/temp ....
    -Update the job_dict for Vrise to work separately for each phases


WOW dure:

 Tickbox for Logo

- Change the way the templates work by separating borders and drawing
-> give the opportuinity to modify just the drawing if neccesarry


- possibilitÃ© de storer les saves online ENCRYPTER
-> includes a smart search
-> tool that measures how much space the saves take
-> possibility to also store just the template
-> possibility to share the templates between solar companies
-> Automatically add the system size to the project save name
-> Option to delete saved project

Down the line:

    - Make it so that all the text on the templates are linked to the first sheet

    - Import all CEC panels and Inv
    -> Option to mark favorites

    - Link with simpro for everyone

    - Other solar tools :
      -> shadow calculator
      -> Optimisation tool (maybe cable size)


Maybe will do:
  - Make a layout for a full screen view (or not)?
    -> If i want to do that it is going to be with window size X and Y

  - NMI, Phone number, email ?
  - Wind regions ??


List of new addition that have not been applied to all templates (on purpose):

  - Block Diagram
  - Voltage rise preferences

Potential improvement (not necessary):
    FILE : "PAGES.PY"
      -> line 54 and 55 -> inv_dict is going to get bigger so I would rather not have it as a self
      -> line 215 and 220 -> could just be set to 0 or 1 instead of "" or 1 -> need to change the VBA
