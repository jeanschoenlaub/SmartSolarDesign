In progress:

- Upgrade the inverter selection bar:
  -> Make a 1P - 3P button (stays blue when pressed) that helps shortens the inverter list
  -> Make a show specs button that allows to quickly see the inverter's specs

Bug fix:

- Foolproof the save function )for example if in page 2 i think bug

Easy/Medium:

    -Improve the show limits function + !!! Voc & Vmp options

    -Vrise upgrade:
        -> Add conductor choice option

    - Upgrade the menuBar

    - Voc to be adjusted for temperature (Idea include table 4.1 of 5033)

    - Overcurrent protection devices sizing

    - Center the layout pages

    - Tickbox for Logo


Hard:

    -Page Redo:
      -Separate page 1-2 and page 3 so that each excel template as his own layout page (i.e template specific folder)
        -> I think Voltage rise needs to come last
        -> down the road they will be the downloadable extension
        -> Maybe the gateway should go into each Template
        -> Same for the excel print function it should be included in the template specific folder

      - Have an first menu (after the login):
        -> Option 1 calculate a Vrise
        -> Option 2 make an sld
        -> Option 3 calculate the output

    -Change the way the Job dict works to add sections depending on job_Type

    -Mixing different Panels

    -Problem when saving an error (For example solar edge mppt b1 a2)

    -Option to add on to existing inverters

    -Battery option -> make a battery_dict

    - Current carrying capacity to be improved for all wire type/temp ....


WOW dure:
- Change the way the templates work by separating borders and drawing
-> give the opportuinity to modify just the drawing if neccesarry


- possibilitÃ© de storer les saves online ENCRYPTER
-> includes a smart search
-> tool that measures how much space the saves take
-> possibility to also store just the template
-> possibility to share the templates between solar companies
-> Automatically add the system size to the project save name
-> Option to delete saved project

Down the line:

    - Make it so that all the text on the templates are linked to the first sheet

    - Import all CEC panels and Inv
    -> Option to mark favorites

    - Link with simpro for everyone

    - Other solar tools :
      -> shadow calculator
      -> Optimisation tool (maybe cable size)


Maybe will do:
  - Make a layout for a full screen view (or not)?
    -> If i want to do that it is going to be with window size X and Y

  - NMI, Phone number, email ?
  - Wind regions ??


List of new addition that have not been applied to all templates (on purpose):

  - Block Diagram
  - Voltage rise preferences

Potential improvement (not necessary):
    FILE : "PAGES.PY"
      -> line 54 and 55 -> inv_dict is going to get bigger so I would rather not have it as a self
      -> line 215 and 220 -> could just be set to 0 or 1 instead of "" or 1 -> need to change the VBA
